##Application of CNN in detecting hand gestures

This is a very basic image classifier. I have added my dataset of images for reference, and they have 6 possible outputs. As a beginner to CNNs myself, these codes are added for beginners to grasp their concepts.

This ConvNet is implemented in TensorFlow. 
I have hard coded some hyperparameters directly into the functions, which can be updated by the user according to their requirements.
